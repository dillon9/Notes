#+TITLE: Kubernetes Components
#+PROPERTY: header-args

Kubernetes is made up of multiple components that work together to make the kubernetes ecosystem.
Some of these components only run on the master node and some run on your other nodes. We will cover
the master node or control plane components first.

* Control plane components
  The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling),
  as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new pod when a
  deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied). Control plane components can be run on any machine in
  the cluster. However, for simplicity, set up scripts typically start all control plane components
  on the same machine, and do not run user containers on this machine
