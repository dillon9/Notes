* OpenSSL commands

** Generate an RSA private key with aes256 encryption
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.pem
#+END_SRC

The ~openssl~ command is used to generate ssl certs of many kinds. Here we use the ~genrsa~ option to make sure we
are generating an ssl key of RSA type. We also passsed  the ~-aes256~ flag to specify we wanted it to have aes256
encryption on the key. Finally we specified the ~-out~ flag to give openssl the destination of where we want the
private key.

** Generate an RSA public key from a private key

This is a test
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.pem
#+END_SRC
of how org mode works
